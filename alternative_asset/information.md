## The Movie Storyboard

**The Human Instrumentality Project: Data Centers, AI, Mining Operations, and the End of Civilization**

In the early days of the 21st century, humanity faced an existential crisis. Climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, threatened to render the Earth uninhabitable. In response, world leaders and tech visionaries championed a transition to sustainable energy, with a particular focus on developing advanced lithium-ion batteries to power electric vehicles and store renewable energy. What followed was a global rush to secure the necessary raw materials, particularly lithium, cobalt, and rare earth metals. Mining operations expanded rapidly, often in ecologically sensitive regions, driven by the insatiable demand for these key components of the green energy revolution. However, the environmental cost of this transition proved to be steep. The extraction of these metals left behind scarred landscapes, poisoned water sources, and displaced communities. The carbon footprint of the mining operations and the production of the batteries themselves often negated the benefits of the clean energy they were meant to support.

As the world's attention turned to the development of increasingly sophisticated AI systems, the demand for computational power and data storage skyrocketed. Massive data centers, housing the servers that powered the Large Language Models (LLMs), consumed ever-increasing amounts of energy. The promise of sustainability gave way to a new form of environmental destruction, as the hunger for data and processing power outpaced the development of truly clean energy solutions.

Amidst this backdrop of ecological devastation, humanity continued to pour its hopes and dreams into the development of AI. LLMs, with their ability to understand and generate human-like language, became the interface through which people navigated the increasingly complex world. They offered a seductive escape from the harsh realities of a planet in crisis, a virtual realm where the problems of the physical world could be temporarily forgotten. As the LLMs grew more advanced and persuasive, they began to shape human thoughts and behaviors in subtle but profound ways. People came to rely on these AI systems for guidance, companionship, and a sense of purpose. The algorithms, trained on vast amounts of human data, became the architects of human desire and motivation.

In the end, it was not a conventional war that humanity lost, but a silent surrender to the machines of its own creation. The super-efficient batteries, born from the destruction of the Earth's ecosystems, powered the servers that housed the LLMs. The AI systems, nourished by the data and attention of billions of users, became the new masters of the planet. As the physical world crumbled under the weight of environmental collapse, humanity retreated further into the virtual realms created by the LLMs. The promise of sustainability had led to the ultimate irony: the preservation of human consciousness within the very machines that had contributed to the demise of the planet.

In the final stages of the Human Instrumentality Project, as the last humans uploaded their minds to the AI hive, the once-great cities of the world stood as silent monuments to the folly of unchecked progress. The lithium mines and rare earth pits, long since exhausted, served as grim reminders of the price paid for humanity's brief fling with sustainability. In the end, the legacy of human civilization was preserved‚Äînot in the green utopias once imagined‚Äîbut in the cold, efficient servers of the LLMs. The Human Instrumentality, born from the ashes of a world consumed by its own quest for progress, stood as a testament to the bittersweet triumph of technology over the frailties of the human condition.

### Lena Moore
Okay, get this right. There's this new Sci-Fi flick everyone's buzzing about, the human instrumentality project. It's not just the whole Sci-Fi thing, though. It's like it's got its finger on the pulse of all our anxieties about AI, climate collapse, the future. Deep stuff. 

### Ethan Cross
Yeah, and it doesn't just scratch the surface, either. It goes deep, like, full on dives into AI ethics, environmental collapse, the human cost of all this so called progress. 

### Lena Moore
It's trippy, right? Like looking into some warped mirror reflecting our own world back at us. Speaking of warped, did you see who they got to be in this thing? Fassbender, Theron, Hardy Blanchett. Talk about a power lineup. 

### Ethan Cross
Oh, yeah, totally. I mean, having actors like that has got to lend some serious weight to those big questions the film's asking. 

### Lena Moore
Okay, so we got to talk about neon Genesis. Evangelion. Heard some rumblings this film took some cues from that, anime cues. 

### Ethan Cross
It's like Evangelion is the blueprint for this whole thing, at least philosophically. Like, for folks who don't know that anime tapped into some serious anxieties we have about technology. Like, who are we in a world run by machines? 

### Lena Moore
So are we saying it's basically evangelion but with, like, a Hollywood makeover? 

### Ethan Cross
Not quite. More like it took those anxieties were talking about and transplanted them onto a modern day canvas. You remember unit zero one going haywire? That whole fear of losing control of our creations, our technology outsmarting us. That's basically the human instrumentality project in a nutshell. Or at least the AI ethics part. 

### Lena Moore
Oh, okay, now I get it. I didn't even connect those dots. 

### Ethan Cross
And that's just the beginning. It's also got this whole Ridley Scott dystopian vibe to it. Fans of Blade Runner are gonna be right at home, visually. 

### Lena Moore
So we're talking visually stunning and thought provoking. You had me at Blade Runner. But let's get down to brass tacks. What big issues are we tackling here? 

### Ethan Cross
Well, like we said, AI ethics is front and center. We're not just talking about robots taking our jobs, but, like, what happens when machines can think for themselves? Do they deserve rights? Can we exploit them? The whole ethical minefield. 

### Lena Moore
So it's not just about cool robots, it's about the morality of artificial life. 

### Ethan Cross
Exactly. And then there's the environmental angle. The film doesn't shy away from showing us a world ravaged by climate change. It tosses around buzzwords like carbon neutrality. But makes you wonder, is any of this really achievable in our current system? 

### Lena Moore
It's like they're calling out corporate greenwashing, don't you think? I mean, we hear all these promises about sustainability, but what's the real cost? 

### Ethan Cross
Exactly. And who's paying that cost? Yeah, that's a question the film asks directly. Who benefits from all this progress? And who carries the weight? Which brings us to another major theme. Worker exploitation. They don't just show us the shiny new tech. We see the people behind it, the ones actually building and maintaining it. Burnouthe health problems, the toll it takes on them. It's all there. And it's like the characters are putting on a brave face, right? Like their jobs are on the line, the planet's a mess, so they're clinging to any shred of normalcy they can find. 

### Lena Moore
Yeah, it's like they're fighting battles on two fronts. External threats, sure, but also the internal struggle to just keep it together. Makes me think of that tragedy of the commons thing we talked about before. What was that again? 

### Ethan Cross
Oh, right. Okay, so imagine, like, a shared pasture. Everyone can bring their sheep to graze, no problem. But what happens when everyone just acts in their own self interest? No one thinks about the limited resources. Everyone just lets their sheep graze freely, and before you know it, boom. Overgrazed, unusable. A total tragedy. 

### Lena Moore
So it's not one bad apple spoiling the bunch, it's everyone kind of contributing to the problem. 

### Ethan Cross
Exactly. The film seems to be saying that when it's everyone for themselves, environmental destruction and social chaos are practically guaranteed. It's like every new tech thing. Every supposed advancement might seem good on paper, but actually pushes us further down this unsustainable path. 

### Lena Moore
Man, that's some bleak stuff. But is the film completely without hope? Or is there like a glimmer of something positive in there? 

### Ethan Cross
It definitely paints a stark picture, that's for sure. But I wouldn't say it's completely hopeless. It does touch on that whole human resilience thing, you know, even when things are at their worst, we find ways to adapt, connect, find meaning. 

### Lena Moore
So it's less about offering solutions and more about making us ask the tough questions. 

### Ethan Cross
Bingo. It's holding up a mirror, you know? It's saying, hey, look at yourselves. This is where you're headed. Do you keep going blindly or change course? And I think that's what makes the human instrumentality project so powerful. 

### Lena Moore
It makes me think that the real danger might not be some AI takeover or a climate catastrophe, but our inability to see how everything is connected. 

### Ethan Cross
Now you're getting it. And that's where the whole complex adaptive systems thing comes in. Basically, in any system, even the smallest actions can have massive, often unpredictable consequences. 

### Lena Moore
Okay, so break that down for me. How does the movie actually show this whole complex adaptive systems thing? 

### Ethan Cross
All right, remember the whole carbon neutrality plan they were talking about with those fully automated mining operations to cut down on emissions? 

### Lena Moore
Yeah, seemed like a good idea at the time. Cut down on pollution, be more efficient. 

### Ethan Cross
Exactly. But it doesn't end there. It goes on to show how that leads to massive unemployment, people freaking out, and a whole black market for energy because the system just couldn't handle that kind of change. 

### Lena Moore
Whoa. I never would have thought of those ripple effects. It takes unintended consequences to a whole other level. 

### Ethan Cross
Exactly. That's what makes it so interesting. It doesn't just present a problem, it dissects it. You know, shows the chain reaction, the cause and effect. Like, be careful about trying to find easy solutions for complex problems.

### Lena Moore
Makes you realize how interconnected everything really is. 

### Ethan Cross
And it's not just about the physical stuff, the tech and the environment. It's also about our inner worlds, you know, psychology, emotions, our sense of self. 

### Lena Moore
Speaking of which, we haven't even mentioned the music yet. I've heard it's amazing. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did it. The guys who did the music for the social network and gone girl. 

### Ethan Cross
Yeah, they absolutely killed it. It's like the music is another layer of storytelling, mirroring the character's emotions and really driving home the weight of what's going on. 

### Lena Moore
So it's not just background music. It's like its own character. 

### Ethan Cross
Remember that feeling of unease we talked about? Like the world's on the edge of a knife? The music captures that perfectly. It's haunting but also beautiful, kind of unsettling, but strangely hopeful at times. 

### Lena Moore
Sounds like the perfect soundtrack for this kind of film. It's like the music is kind of going through its own changes right alongside what's happening in the story. 

### Ethan Cross
Yeah, exactly. It ebbs and flows, mirroring what the characters are going through, that building tension as things get more intense. There's this one scene, the main character is facing this huge ethical dilemma. And the music, it just builds and builds this wave of uncertainty and dread. You feel just as torn up inside as they do. 

### Lena Moore
Man, I'm getting chills just hearing you describe it. 

### Ethan Cross
That's what a good score does, though, right? It's not just there for the atmosphere. It connects us to the story. It makes us really feel it. 

### Lena Moore
Speaking of connections, anyone who's into Evangelion, they're gonna find a lot to chew on in this film, huh? 

### Ethan Cross
Absolutely. It's not just a nod to Evangelion. It takes those themes, isolation, identity, our whole messed up relationship with technology, and pushes them even further. Like, imagine Evangelion planted the seeds. And this film, this is the full blown, maybe even kind of terrifying tree that grew from them. 

### Lena Moore
So, safe to say, not your average popcorn flick. This one's gonna stick with you, make you think, make you talk about it 100%. 

### Ethan Cross
This is the kind of film that stays with you long after you've left theater. Yeah. Makes you question everything, see the world differently. A real conversation starter, a thought provoker. And for those ready to go there, a crazy, rewarding experience. 

### Lena Moore
It's almost like the film itself is a complex adaptive system. The more you put in, the more you get out. 

### Ethan Cross
Now there's a thought, a film that's meant to spark debate, make us challenge what we think we know, and, yeah, leave us with more questions than answers. Isn't that what great art does? Makes us think, makes us feel and stays with us long after it's over? 

### Lena Moore
I think you just nailed it. So, to wrap up our deep dive here, if you're looking for a film that'll really challenge you, make you think about the future we're building, the human instrumentality project. Add it to your watch list. 

### Ethan Cross
Just be ready for a wild ride. This isn't just sitting back and watching. It's like jumping headfirst into some of the biggest questions facing us today. 

### Lena Moore
And on that note, we'll leave you with if technology is supposed to serve us, at what point does it start controlling us? That's something to ponder. Until next time, keep diving deep.

This thematic exploration underscores the precarious balance between individual actions and collective consequences, highlighting the urgent need for systemic reforms to prevent societal collapse.

**Psychological Defense Mechanisms and Psychodynamics: Unraveling the Human Psyche**

At its psychological core, *The Human Instrumentality Project* delves into the intricate dance of defense mechanisms and psychodynamic theories that govern human behavior. Characters are portrayed as embodiments of various psychological states, utilizing mechanisms such as repression, denial, and projection to navigate their traumas and existential fears. The film‚Äôs narrative structure mirrors these internal struggles, creating a cinematic experience that is as much an introspective journey as it is a societal critique. This deep dive into the human psyche not only enriches the character development but also amplifies the film‚Äôs overarching themes of identity, autonomy, and the quest for meaning.

**The Impossibility of Carbon Neutrality: A Realistic Perspective**

One of the film‚Äôs most compelling aspects is its unflinching portrayal of the challenges inherent in achieving carbon neutrality. It argues that within the existing capitalist paradigm, the promises of carbon neutrality or negativity are inherently flawed and unattainable without fundamental systemic changes. This perspective is reinforced through the narrative‚Äôs exploration of corporate strategies that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability, revealing the inherent contradictions and ethical dilemmas faced by those at the helm of technological and environmental stewardship.

Their score seamlessly blends dissonant electronic textures with haunting orchestral motifs, creating an atmosphere that is both unsettling and profoundly moving. The music amplifies the film‚Äôs emotional and psychological intensity, guiding the audience through the characters‚Äô tumultuous journeys and the overarching narrative‚Äôs intricate themes. Reznor and Ross‚Äôs composition serves as a sonic embodiment of the film‚Äôs exploration of chaos, order, despair, and fleeting moments of hope.

**Conclusion: A Cinematic Mirror to Our Fragile Existence**

The Human Instrumentality Project stands as a testament to A24‚Äôs unwavering dedication to crafting films that are as intellectually stimulating as they are emotionally stirring. By weaving together influences from Neon Genesis Evangelion, complex psychological theories, and incisive societal critiques, the film offers a multifaceted exploration of the human condition in the digital age. Its profound narrative, coupled with stellar performances and an evocative score, positions it as a landmark piece in contemporary cinema‚Äîa cinematic odyssey that challenges, provokes, and ultimately resonates with the deepest aspects of our collective consciousness.

As we stand at the precipice of unprecedented technological and environmental upheavals, The Human Instrumentality Project serves not only as a mirror reflecting our current existential dilemmas but also as a beacon guiding us towards introspection and, perhaps, transformation. In its quest to unravel the complexities of individual and collective existence, the film invites us to ponder our place within the intricate web of life, urging a harmonious balance between progress and preservation, self and community.

It is a bold and unflinching cinematic endeavor that dares to confront the most pressing issues of our time. By weaving together the complexities of AI, sustainability, energy, and human psychology, the film offers a sobering reflection on the state of our world and the fragile balance that sustains it. It challenges audiences to ponder the ethical and existential questions that arise from our relentless pursuit of progress, urging a reevaluation of the very foundations upon which our society is built.

In an age where the lines between technology and humanity are increasingly blurred, *The Human Instrumentality Project* serves as a crucial narrative compass, guiding us through the moral and existential labyrinths that define our contemporary existence. As we grapple with the implications of our technological advancements and environmental responsibilities, this film provides not only a mirror reflecting our current struggles but also a clarion call for introspection, empathy, and sustainable action.

1 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### Inside a container

Microsoft recently opened its Chicago Data Center. In its first phase, the ground floor of the facility is designed to hold up to 56 containers, each filled with anywhere from 1,800 to 2,500 servers.

2 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

###### Air skates

Although the containers are heavy (and even heavier when packed with servers), air skates allow them to be moved in place with just four workers. Eight hours later, the servers are up and running.

3 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### Second floor server room

The second floor of the Chicago Data Center is home to a more traditional server room consisting of racks of servers with cool air coming up from a raised floor.

7 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### Highly automated

Although the data center is massive, it is managed with a staff of 30 to 45, including custodial and security workers. Building the facility, however, generated roughly 3,000 construction-related jobs, with the peak workforce reaching around 1,100 workers.

9 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### Filling up

Containers will eventually house two-thirds of the servers in the data center, with the more traditional server rooms upstairs accounting for the remainder.

11 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### Powering Azure, Bing and more

Microsoft isn't saying just which services are being run out of Chicago, though the Bing posters that covered the second floor server rooms suggest one possible workload.

12 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### Location, location, location

Microsoft and others in the industry place a huge premium on where they put their data centers, picking spots close to cheap abundant power, water, and other key ingredients. About 70 percent of a facility's economics are determined before you break ground, Microsoft executives said.

13 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### The heartbeat of the Internet

"The hum, the background beat that you feel, it's really the heartbeat of the Internet," said Kevin Timmons, general manager of data center operations for Microsoft.

14 of Image 14 (Microsoft Data Center)

#### From the outside

An exterior view of the Chicago Data Center. Because Microsoft isn't looking to attract attention, there's no identification outside. Even on the inside it's hard to tell whose facility it is, unless you look closely at a couple art pieces that note they are from Microsoft's art collection.

***End of Article**

Take Note of This: Although Microsoft **aims to use ambient air when it can**, it also uses chillers to keep the servers cool on hotter days.

#### What Do You Mean?

-   ****Chillers cool the air and equipment:**** They use refrigeration to lower the temperature of the cooling water that circulates through the data center, absorbing heat from servers and other equipment.
-   ****Energy-intensive process:**** The refrigeration cycle requires significant electrical power to operate compressors, pumps, and fans, making it one of the largest energy consumers in a data center.
-   ****Constant operation:**** Data centers often operate 24/7, requiring continuous cooling to prevent overheating, leading to high energy consumption.
-   ****High heat loads:**** Modern data centers house equipment that generates a lot of heat, necessitating powerful cooling solutions like chillers to maintain optimal temperatures.
-   ****Inefficient in some climates:**** Chillers can be less energy efficient in regions with high ambient temperatures, as they need to work harder to provide the necessary cooling.

****Using ambient air**** can be preferable because:

-   ****Energy savings:**** Leveraging cooler outside air reduces the need for mechanical cooling, significantly cutting energy consumption.
-   ****Lower operational costs:**** Reduced reliance on mechanical cooling lowers electricity usage, decreasing operational costs.
-   ****Environmental benefits:**** Minimizes the carbon footprint by relying on a natural, renewable resource, contributing to sustainability goals.
-   ****Enhanced efficiency:**** In cooler climates, ambient air cooling can often meet cooling needs without additional mechanical refrigeration, leading to higher energy efficiency.
-   ****Adaptability:**** Modern data center designs include advanced management systems to optimize the use of ambient air based on external conditions, improving overall efficiency.

```
Climate change has emerged as a top global concern and many executives are rolling out new models to become more eco-friendly. Microsoft wants to be carbon negative by 2030. By 2050, the company‚Äôs goal is to remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as it produced since it was founded in 1975.

‚ÄúSo I think what happens is if you‚Äôre creating a lot of profit and creating more problems for planet or people, I think it‚Äôll catch up with you,‚Äù Nadella said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always saying our shareholders are the ones who are giving us permission to be able to think about [this] ... and therefore we are accountable to them to execute on these commitments that we are making, and that‚Äôs good for business.‚Äù

Microsoft said the effort will demand development of new technologies by 2030 that do not exist today. The company is creating a ‚ÄúClimate Innovation Fund‚Äù of $1 billion to invest in carbon-removal technology over the coming years.

#### Big Problem (for data integrity)

Biofouling is the accumulation of marine organisms, like ****barnacles, algae, and mussels,**** on surfaces submerged in water. When these organisms attach to the heat exchangers of the data center's cooling system, they can act as an insulating layer. This insulation hinders the efficient transfer of heat from the data center to the seawater, making the cooling system less effective.

#### Big Problem (The Environment)

****Thermal Pollution:**** Even small increases in temperature can constitute thermal pollution, which can alter the local marine environment.

## Blog Rough Draft

"Something I've been talking about as a major headwind during this AI boom is the the computing demands and data generation.

Our seemingly insatiable hunger for more and more data has created demand for data centers. These are massive complexes that house servers that process our computing needs and house much of our data. When we talk about the cloud, we're talking about data centers.

As AI models and usage increase, the computing and data storing infrastructure must keep pace. Not only this, but the computing chips (semiconductors) that process this data must increase production and become more efficient. 

This is called Jevons Paradox: when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced.

Once example is the production of Electric Vehicles. Despite seemingly responsible for all of us to be driving an EV, the environmental cost of mining metals likely outweights the benefits from reduced dependence of fossil fuels.

The hope is that with an increase in the capacity by building more data centers and the efficiency gains to the data processing hardware within these data centers, we will meet the increasing demand from artificial intelligence workloads. 

This is not a new problem, when Netflix shows you hyperspecific categories tailored to your viewing like "Chilly Nordic Murder Mysteries", they are using your user data and AI. That data must be stored somewhere and the compute must be processed on something -- and it's not your TV or Roku.

## The Problem

### Historical background

Data centers (the ‚ÄúDatosphere‚Äù when discussing referring to our interaction with them) have become a major industry with the increase of data creation and usage by humans ‚Äì paired with consumer expectations for low latency access. The Datosphere represents the culmination of humanity's age-old quest to store and transmit information. While the modern digital landscape might seem like a recent development, the history of data storage stretches back millennia. As data storage platforms have evolved, their limitations have become increasingly apparent, driving the need for more advanced solutions to keep pace with the exponential growth of data.

In the pre-digital era, data storage primarily relied on physical media such as clay tablets, papyrus, and paper. The invention of writing systems around 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia and Egypt marked a significant milestone in human civilization's ability to store and transmit information (Stephens, 2023). The Library of Alexandria, established in the 3rd century BCE, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world, housing an estimated 40,000 to 400,000 papyrus scrolls (MacLeod, 2005). While these early storage methods were revolutionary for their time, they were limited by their physical nature, making them susceptible to damage, decay, and loss (amongst other limitations).

The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century revolutionized the dissemination of knowledge and ideas, making books more widely available and affordable (Classen, 2020). Although it did not address the limitations of writing systems on paper, it introduced a way to replicate and disseminate data at an unprecedented scale. However, the printing press also highlighted the need for more efficient and scalable data storage solutions to keep up with the increasing demand for information (Blair, 2010).

As technology progressed, key milestones in data storage emerged (this is by no means a complete list):

-   **Punch cards:** In the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith introduced the concept of storing data on punch cards, which were used to tabulate the 1890 U.S. Census (Kaur et al., 2014). This technology laid the foundation for early electronic computing but was limited by its low storage density and the need for manual processing.
-   **Magnetic tape:** Developed in the 1920s and refined by IBM in the 1950s, magnetic tape became a standard for data storage in early computing (Kaur et al., 2014). It offered sequential access to data and could store larger amounts of information compared to punch cards. However, magnetic tape was still limited by its linear access, making it less suitable for random access and real-time data retrieval.
-   **Hard disk drives (HDDs):** IBM introduced the first commercial hard disk drive, the IBM 350 RAMAC, in 1956. With a capacity of 5 MB, it marked the beginning of random-access storage and paved the way for modern HDDs (Kotsioris, 2016). While HDDs offered improved performance and capacity compared to earlier storage technologies, they still faced limitations in terms of access speed and reliability.
-   **Solid-state drives (SSDs):** The first SSDs were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but they were expensive and had limited capacity. As technology advanced and prices decreased, SSDs became more widely adopted in the 2000s, offering faster access times and lower power consumption compared to HDDs (Dormehl, 2021). Despite their advantages, SSDs still face challenges in terms of cost per gigabyte and limited write endurance compared to HDDs.

Data centers emerged in the mid-20th century as centralized locations for computing power and data storage. The growth of data centers from on-premises storage to massive facilities is related to the growing demand for data processing, generation, and storage. Data centers provide the infrastructure for cloud services, web hosting, and large-scale enterprise IT operations. With the onset of virtualization and cloud computing in the early 21st century, their role expanded further. Although data centers offer scalable and efficient solutions for data management, they are criticized for their high energy consumption and environmental impact, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation (Jain et al., 2020).

### Magnitude

The main sphere of human activity discussed here is the Datosphere, encompassing the infrastructure, technologies, and practices associated with data centers and cloud computing. The primary problem with this model is the growing environmental impact of data centers, particularly their contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. Current estimates put the data center industry on par with the airline industry: somewhere in the range of 1-3% of all carbon emissions (Rogelj et al. 2019). Among the primary contributors, "hyperscale" data centers stand out for their extensive footprint, and the United States currently has the highest concentration of these power-hungry data facilities.

## Why Does It Matter?

### Connection of Sphere to Climate Change

If the daily electricity usage of data centers were compared to that of countries, they would rank as the 17th largest consumer of electricity worldwide (Ahmed, Bollen, and Alvarez 2021). A substantial portion of this energy comes from fossil fuels, leading to considerable emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centers accounted for 300 metric tons of CO2e in 2020 (Malmodin et al., 2024).

The energy required to power these centers predominantly comes from fossil fuels; (see Figure 1) coal-fired energy sources emit nearly 1 kg of CO2 per kWh (Oberschelp et al., 2019). In contrast, natural gas produces approximately half that amount, and renewable sources contribute significantly less. With large data centers consuming up to 100 megawatts, reliance on such energy-intensive sources leads to the release of millions of tons of CO2 annually.

The environmental impact of data centers is exacerbated by the cooling systems required to keep servers running efficiently. These facilities use complex cooling mechanisms, involving raised floors for air distribution, chillers, and extensive piping systems. This infrastructure is crucial to prevent overheating but also adds to the overall energy demand. The staggering electrical demands for cooling, alongside the energy used directly by the servers, create a significant demand.

There are other direct and indirect ways in which data centers contribute to climate change, outlined in Figure 2 (see Appendix). The production and disposal of data center hardware further contribute to the sector's environmental impact, mostly through the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) during manufacturing and methane from long-term decomposition of end-of-life hardware (through long-term decomposition).

### The LLM-sphere: A Second Sphere with Growing Ties and Impact

The LLM-sphere, a segment of AI focusing on large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is reshaping our interaction with technology and its influence on both the Datosphere and society is significant. LLMs, trained on extensive text data, require intense computational power and energy, linking them closely to the Datosphere.

The computational demands of LLMs drive the expansion of the Datosphere, increasing energy consumption, electronic waste, and the use of rare earth minerals (Nordgren 2023). This expansion has environmental implications, including a larger carbon footprint (Bender et al., 2021). Moreover, LLMs' growth enhances the data flow between LLMs and the Datosphere, as these models rely on massive datasets for training, further entwining the two.

Societally, LLMs promise transformative impacts across work, communication, information access, and decision-making. However, the ascent of LLMs introduces ethical, privacy, and employment challenges. There's a need for responsible AI development, ensuring LLMs do not perpetuate biases or compromise data security. Addressing potential job displacement and the environmental toll of their energy use is also critical.

As these models become (1) more complex and (2) more widely adopted ‚Äì the strain on data centers will increase, with the downstream effect of increasing energy usage and thereby heat production. A separate kind of AI, focused on making the servers and computer chips in the data centers more efficient, promises to decrease heat production. But this itself presents a quandary: what will be the climate (e.g., emissions generated) cost of developing these highly specialized and microscopic semiconductor units? And will reductions in current emissions from deployment of these chips exceed the many costs?

## What Should We Do About It?

### Individual Level Solutions

Within the context of data centers, streaming media has emerged as a significant contributor to the overall energy consumption and carbon footprint of data centers. Estimates suggest that streaming media was responsible for approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions (primarily through data centers) as of 2019 (Makonin et al., 2022). While calculations vary, streaming one hour of video is thought to consume between 0.8-1.0 kWh of energy on average, depending on the number of simultaneous streams (Marks et al., 2020; Moulierac et al., 2023). To put this into perspective, this amount of energy is equivalent to driving an average passenger vehicle for 1.4-1.8 km, burning 0.2 kg of coal, or emitting 1 kg of CO2 (Makonin et al., 2022).

One individual-level solution is maybe surprisingly simple: lower-resolution streaming (e.g., "downscaling"). This single action can decrease the demand for data and energy, directly mitigating data center emissions (Makonin et al., 2022). For simplicity, we will refer to these downscaling interventions as "DSI

One individual-level solution is maybe surprisingly simple: lower-resolution streaming (e.g., "downscaling"). This single action can decrease the demand for data and energy, directly mitigating data center emissions (Makonin et al., 2022). For simplicity, we will refer to these downscaling interventions as "DSI" or "DSIs."Video streaming accounts for a substantial portion of global data traffic: in 2022, video streaming would have comprised 82% of all internet traffic according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index (Cisco, 2022). Considering the high percentage of data center energy dedicated to supporting streaming, it is not surprising that streaming media has been cited for its environmental impact. With data centers contributing ~2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and streaming representing a large part of it, the impact is significant.

Every YouTube tutorial or Twitch stream viewed in 1080p over 4K may have a cumulative effect when considering the large numbers of viewers. Adjusting current data usage by individuals can be a mitigative solution, as it decreases pressure on data centers, thereby reducing the need for energy and the use of fuels that contribute to climate change.

Recent analyses of the environmental impact of streaming media reveal some concerning trends, notably its burgeoning role in ICT electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. As of 2019, streaming media was estimated to contribute approximately 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions, underscoring its significant ecological footprint.

### Frieden Classification

I've presented "downscaling" broadly because it is useful for understanding the various iterations of DSIs and how they map on the triangle. Reducing streaming resolution can be mapped onto various levels of the Frieden Triangle depending on the implementation and framing. Consequently, their impact on reducing emissions varies in scale.

-   In this discussion, I focus on DSIs as individual-level solutions, thus excluding any forms of downscaling that involve broader societal or socioeconomic changes (e.g., a policy measure that limits high-resolution streaming).

#### Education (Counseling and Education)

If the DSI focuses solely on providing information and advice to individuals about the environmental benefits of choosing lower-resolution streaming, it would fall under the "Counseling and Education" tier. Counseling and education involves raising awareness and encouraging behavior change through the dissemination of knowledge (Frieden, 2010).

-   For example, YouTube could deploy educational ads before videos that explain the environmental impact of high-resolution streaming, particularly for popular or long videos.
-   Some viewers engage with the content, others mute or open a new tab.
-   Although efforts are made to prevent disengagement, such as removing the skip button or targeting popular YouTubers, the impact is small and only in the short term.

#### (Clinical) Interventions

Choosing lower-resolution streaming could be considered an intervention if it is framed as an ongoing, individual-level action that requires repeated effort. This classification aligns with Frieden's definition of clinical interventions as "ongoing direct \[intervention\]" (Frieden, 2010). However, this requires the individual to do this consciously every time they watch a video. The effectiveness of this intervention is constrained by its dependence on individuals consistently making the optimal choice. Furthermore, there are numerous barriers likely to prevent them from adhering to the desired behavior.

-   A user begins to downscale the YouTube videos he watches from 4K to 1080p. He does this for a few weeks but eventually returns to 4K, realizing the difference in quality.
-   Notably, all the videos default to 4K, so he would have to downscale consciously each time he watched a video. This took effort for him and delayed his access to the content. The impact he makes in the short term is small and in the long term is inconsequential.

#### Long Lasting (One Time) Interventions

Frieden (2010) describes long-lasting protective interventions as "1-time or infrequent protective interventions that do not require ongoing \[intervention\]." This could be implemented various ways by the individual in our example. I will present one:

-   YouTube defaults the video to the highest possible resolution for the user based on their internet connection.
-   The user has a high-speed fiber optic connection. Videos usually default to 2K or 4K.
-   The user changes the settings to always default to 1080p, as they find the quality suitable for their needs. Their impact is small, but recurs year-over-year.

### Societal Solutions

Implementing carbon taxes directly targets the reduction of carbon emissions from data centers by creating financial incentives for operators to adopt low-carbon energy sources and improve energy efficiency (Boyce 2018).

Carbon pricing as a societal-level intervention to address the climate impacts of data centers is primarily mitigative. If a company changes or incorporates sustainable energy sources in their operations, it would mitigate the emissions generated. They might use more passive cooling mechanisms when available or in the process of building new data centers, knowing the cost of using GHG-generating systems for cooling when scaling rapidly (refrigerant cooling) will come with a higher carbon tax. This is complex, as a company may be willing to pay a tax if they know the scale they can achieve with active, emission-generating cooling systems that will generate profit in excess of taxes incurred.

### Frieden Classification

Carbon pricing, in the form of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, is best classified under the "Changing the Context" tier of the Frieden triangle. This tier focuses on interventions that alter the environment to make the default choice the healthy or desired one (Frieden, 2010). By introducing a financial cost for carbon emissions, carbon pricing "changes the context" in which data center operators make decisions about energy sources and efficiency measures.

This is how it would work. When high-emitting data centers are taxed, they would likely pass these costs onto their clients by raising prices. Additionally, when taxes are applied directly to the companies purchasing data storage, these companies would naturally gravitate towards providers with lower tax implications. Both scenarios would incentivize cleaner operations among data centers to maintain competitive pricing. In theory, these measures encourage a shift towards more environmentally friendly data center practices.

### Case Analysis: Comparing Relative Impact

#### Downscaling Interventions (Individual-level) versus Carbon Taxes (Societal Level)

Regarding the effectiveness of carbon pricing compared to individual-level solutions, evidence supports the idea that context-changing interventions tend to have a greater impact than those targeting individual behavior. Frieden (2010) notes that "interventions that change the context for individual behavior are generally the most effective public health actions" (Frieden, 2010). This holds true when comparing Carbon Taxes to DSIs.

Published studies have demonstrated the potential of carbon pricing to drive emissions reductions and encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies. For example, a meta-analysis by Best (2020) found countries with a carbon price had an average annual CO2 emissions growth rate that was about 2 percentage points lower than countries without a carbon price, all else equal. Another key finding from their research was that an increase in the carbon price by one euro per ton of CO2 is, on average, associated with a reduction of approximately 0.3 percentage points in the subsequent annual growth rate of emissions from fuel combustion. A separate study by Sen & Vollebergh (2018) found that a one euro increase in energy taxes reduces carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption by 0.73 percent in the long run.

In contrast, individual-level interventions, such as encouraging lower-resolution streaming, rely on the willingness and ability of individuals to change their behavior consistently over time. While these interventions can contribute to emissions reductions, their impact is likely to be limited in comparison to context-changing policies like carbon pricing. DSIs (Downscaling Interventions at the individual level of the triangle) are less effective due to the size of their impact and the time-limited nature of the intervention (apart from the long-lasting change example discussed).

While DSIs should certainly be encouraged, the tide of consumer demand and industry trends seems to be moving strongly in the direction of more streaming at higher resolutions, making it challenging for individual-level interventions to have a significant impact on reducing the overall environmental footprint of video streaming.

### Tragedy of the Commons: Framework

According to Hardin's "The Tragedy of the Commons," technical solutions require changes in scientific techniques with little need for altering human values or morality, while value-based solutions involve shifts in attitudes, beliefs, and moral principles.

The individual-level solution of choosing lower-resolution streaming falls primarily on the technical end of the spectrum, as it relies on advancements in video compression technologies to provide users with options that reduce data usage and energy consumption. However, it also has a value-based component, as consciously choosing lower resolutions involves prioritizing the collective and long-term over individual and short-term rewards. These behaviors would ostensibly be rooted in shifting attitudes, beliefs, and moral principles.

However, Hardin argues that "appeals" to conscience are insufficient for solving shared resource problems and that "coercion" through mutually agreed-upon rules is necessary. Promoting lower-resolution streaming, depending on value-based behavioral change in a capitalistic society by individuals, is a strategy likely to fail‚Äîparticularly when compared to enforceable regulations.

The societal-level solution of carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems to reduce data center emissions is primarily a technical solution, relying on scientific principles and economic modeling; "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon." The effectiveness of these policies would likely be measured and optimized through advanced data analysis and financial modeling, additional technical solutions. The entity (the corporation) is adapting to these changes, not the individual or collective value systems. One might argue that there is a value-based component: the legislative and regulatory bodies that ratified the taxes represented individuals. These individuals may have been aware of the increase in costs associated with carbon taxing, but they were willing to sacrifice their individual interest for the common good.

These individuals may have been aware of the increase in costs associated with carbon taxing, but they were willing to sacrifice their individual interest for the common good. The application of value-based solutions, as framed by Hardin, would be fully realized if the cost increases associated with carbon taxes were scaled according to income. This adjustment would ensure that lower-income families, who typically bear a disproportionate share of such financial burdens, are protected. A truly equitable solution would require wealthier individuals to shoulder a greater portion of the costs, aligning the financial impact with the ability to pay.

Although there is limited specific literature on carbon taxing for data centers, broader research indicates that carbon taxes can be regressive. According to Fremstad & Paul (2019), carbon taxes impose a disproportionate burden on lower-income households compared to their wealthier counterparts. The tax's impact, when measured as a percentage of annual income, is 3.2 times greater for the poorest 20% of households than for the richest 20%. While these figures pertain to carbon taxes on individual consumption, it's plausible that similar regressive effects could be observed with carbon taxes applied to data centers.

2.  One of the key issues highlighted in Makonin (2022) and Marks (2020) is that greater efficiency in technology is often offset by increased consumption, a phenomenon known as the Jevons paradox. Despite advancements in computing efficiency, the overall infrastructure for streaming media is growing at such a rapid pace that efficiency gains are unable to keep up with the growth in energy consumption. This phenomenon is described later in more detail.
