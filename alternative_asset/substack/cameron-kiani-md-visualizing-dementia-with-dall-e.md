# Visualizing Dementia with DALL-E
This blog post serves as a visual exploration, a series of AI-generated images showing the relationship between pollution and dementia. They also serve capture the impact these have on one's sense of self and identity — bringing to light the unseen dimensions of this complex condition. 

My goal was to test DALL-E's ability to create visualizations around abstract concepts — particularly the intersection of biomedical explanations, environmental causes, and phenomenological narratives related to dementia.

For context on the next two images — here are snippets from the paper I had been writing on pollution and dementia:

>  _As we collectively become aware of the environmental hazards as both precipitating and perpetuating disease, another disease has come into focus: Dementia. Historically, dementia has been understood and studied at an individual level through a biomedical model. Pathology rooted in the brain — a result of misfolded and misplaced proteins. This epistemological approach, rooted in biomedical explanations, has traditionally been viewed as more valid. However, this focus is myopic. While it is not invalid, it is incomplete […] Disease as a function of social conditions remains controversial in spaces that center proximate risk factors. It has been nearly two decades since Krieger questioned the prevailing explanatory model for disease, one that seeks out a “putative spider” around which the entire “web” is spun. This paper aims to upend the prevailing narrative, not to disprove biomedical models, but to bring sociocultural, economic, and environmental variables into view. By “balancing the scales” this author hopes to center the individual with dementia within a more complete framework. The reframing of the disease in the previous sentence is intentional. By decentralizing the disease, it allows us to re-center the individual, their lived experience, and — critically — their social and environmental exposures. This is not a political or moral action on the author’s part: the framing ensures the focus does not deviate from the social contributions to the individual._
