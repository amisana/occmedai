# Unmasking the Superheroes Among Us
This is the story of how I started a team of superheroes with the help of my friends.

Here's how it unfolded. I was in my element — bothering people at work while they tried to do their jobs. I told Marcel, who works as a doorman in my building, about ChatGPT. I told him about an idea that had just come to mind — could we make him into a Superhero? He was game. 

First, Marcel dictated a brief biography about himself that the ChatGPT iOS app transcribed:
    
    
     **Input:** Okay, so my name is Marcel I grew up in Guyana. I love to play cricket and have a good time. Need more…? [Me whispering: Do you have any hobbies? ]. My hobby is working. I don't like baseball. I prefer football. I eat two meals a day. I don't have dinner in the evening. [Me whispering: where do you live now?] I live in Queens. With my wife and two kids. Very happily, so.. Okay.

This was the input to ChatGPT. We dictated the following:
    
    
     **Input:** Now, can you write a superhero story in the style of Marvel that is about me? Give me an interesting backstory about me growing up in Guyana, and how I got my powers, and write the story as though it's a full Marvel movie. I'm a doorman by day, but at night, I am a superhero.

###  **The Cricket Crusader is Born**

The ChatGPT application (running GPT-4) begins feverishly churning out a superhero story based on our inputs. In less than five minutes from starting on this journey, the Cricket Crusader was born. Here’s a snippet.
    
    
    Our tale begins in the verdant landscapes of Guyana, where a young Marcel spends his days playing cricket and his nights dreaming of something bigger. One fateful night, while Marcel is practicing his cricket swing under the bright Caribbean moon, a meteor falls from the sky, landing straight on his cricket bat. The impact doesn't hurt Marcel; instead, it imbues him with a strange energy.
    
    Years later, Marcel moves to Queens, New York, seeking a new life. He finds work as a doorman, a job that suits his affable nature and provides plenty of human interaction. But it's a humble life, far removed from the heroic dreams he once harbored.
    
    However, destiny has a way of catching up. One evening, Marcel witnesses a mugging in his neighborhood. Old instincts kick in, and for the first time in years, he uses his powers, saving the victim and scaring off the attackers.
    
    This incident inspires Marcel. He realizes he can't ignore his abilities and decides to use them to protect his adopted city. By day, he is the friendly doorman, Marcel from Guyana, but by night, he transforms into the Cricket Crusader.

I asked ChatGPT provide a detailed and colorful description of Marcel’s superhero appearance. Here is a summary of what it spit out:
    
    
    His superhero suit is a vivid spectacle, blending elements of his Guyanese heritage with the needs of a modern vigilante. The suit's primary color is a deep green, mirroring the lush landscapes of his homeland. Patches of shimmering gold run along the suit's contours, representing Guyana's rich mineral resources and lending an air of majesty. His emblem, a cricket bat and ball crossed against a stylized 'M', adorns his chest in brilliant silver.
    
    His mask, a blend of gold and green, leaves his eyes uncovered, allowing him to connect with those he saves and letting his unyielding determination shine through. A golden cape, symbolic of the cricket pitch, billows behind him, making him an unforgettable sight against the moonlit city skyline. Every detail of the Cricket Crusader, from his symbolic colors to his high-tech gear, narrates the story of Marcel - a hero born of cricket, Guyana, and his unwavering will to protect his city.

With a description work from, I used another prompt to output a Midjourney-friendly prompt (Midjourney generates images from text). The output of this prompt was shared at the start of this post.
    
    
     **Input:** Cricket Crusader superhero, beacon of hope, deep green and gold armor mirroring Guyana's richness, chest decorated with a silver cricket emblem, suit built for endurance, gauntlets stowing necessities, silent boots, golden cape waving like a cricket field, mask leaving room for his determined gaze, cricket bat glowing cyan from alien alloy, cricket bat in hand, cricket bat logo --ar 16:9 --q 1 --chaos 20 --s 900

Since the Cricket Crusader emerged, superheroes have been rapidly emerging from hiding:

#### `Javier, “The Guardian”`

    Javier, an El Salvador-born doorman in New York City, taps into the powers granted to him by an ancient Salvadoran artifact to transform into the Guardian, skillfully fusing his strategic mind, salsa rhythm, and Salvadoran tenacity to shield his city and the people he loves from danger. He is a fan of music, especially salsa and reggaeton, using the rhythm to enhance his fighting style, making it as fluid and unpredictable as a dance. This unique fighting style became his signature move, often disorienting his enemies while entertaining bystanders. The Guardian's heart, however, remained his greatest power. His love for his three children fueled his heroism, giving him the strength and determination to protect not just them, but the city they all call home.

#### `The Bronx Brawler `

    In the heart of the South Bronx, beneath the shadow of the high-rise buildings, a hero was born. His name was Sebastian, th child of a Puerto Rican immigrant family, known for his strength, courage, and unyielding spirit. Arnold grew up among the tenacious denizens of the Bronx, their resilience mirrored in his very being. He took refuge in the world of comic books, his favorite being the tales of The Punisher, Daredevil, and the X-Men. He had a love for heavy metal music - Korn, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails - the raw power of the genre resonated with his fierce spirit. Sebastian, a Puerto Rican comic book-loving, heavy metal enthusiast from the South Bronx, unexpectedly awakens kinetic powers during a workout, transforming into the superhero "Bronx Brawler". Embodying his neighborhood's spirit of resilience and courage, and drawing inspiration from his favorite comics and metal bands, Sebastian bastpatrols his city in a suit echoing the Puerto Rican flag's colors, standing as a symbol of strength and a legendary figure in the Bronx.

 **Word begins to spread. Heroes beyond the five-boroughs begin to emerge.**

Sebastian (The Bronx Brawler) shared his origin story with his friend Giovanni. Sebstian told me that Gio wanted to know if I could create his backstory. He noted that Gio was very proud of his Aztec roots, and that Gio wanted to be sure that this was reflected in his narrative. Sebastian forwarded the text from Gio and we fed the text into ChatGPT and yet another hero was born.
    
    
     **Input:** New Hero: **** "back story Giovanni lives in Texas  works hard very hard on air conditioning he's also a porter his favorite team is the colts he's Dominican / Mexican he loves his Aztec heritage he likes to laugh a lot and loves history and he loves to speak his mind he loves animals like dogs and cats he loves the Beatles and system of the down did I mention he works hard”

#### `Gio, the Guardian of the Gale`

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89adc8a3-5961-468e-b9cb-ea48c46762a6_1024x1024.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89adc8a3-5961-468e-b9cb-ea48c46762a6_1024x1024.png)
    
    
    Giovanni, known as the Guardian of the Gale, is an extraordinary individual residing in Texas who balances his daily life as an air conditioning technician and porter with his heroic alter ego. Of Dominican and Mexican descent, he cherishes his Aztec roots and uses an ancient artifact imbued with the power and knowledge of the Aztec civilization, which he discovered during his day job. This empowers him to control the elements and protect his city. By day, he is an unassuming worker; by night, he becomes the Guardian of the Gale, defending his city with the heart of an Aztec warrior and the spirit of a Texan.

###  **Walking Amongst Giants**

I’ve offered and been asked to teach others how to use ChatGPT and adjacent platforms. I’ve spent a lot of time interfacing with the model and certainly have some knowledge to impart.

What I can offer now is: the best way to interface with these generative AI tools is to approach them with an existential frame. Approach them with wonder and excitement. That night, we were all enraptured in the stories that ChatGPT generated about the Bronx Brawler or the Cricket Crusader. I volunteered to do the dramatic reading, and despite our wide ranging ages and backgrounds, it felt like we were all kids — sitting around a campfire, regaling each other with tall imaginary tales where we were the main characters.

And out of this, something else emerged. For example, I learned that Javier was a skilled salsa dancer. At first, it was fodder for GPT to build his superhero backstory… But after, I found myself engaged in a deeper conversation about his love for salsa. When was the last time he had the chance to wax poetic about his salsa moves? A seemingly vacuous activity by an annoying tenant (hopefully) opened the door for deeper connections and conversations, predicated on a hotly-debated Generative AI platform. 

If Generative AI has any prosocial value, it’s reminding us that we’re all walking amongst superheroes[1](https://hanlonsrazor.substack.com/p/unmasking-the-superheroes-among-us#footnote-1-135526851).

Certainly built on the hard work and creativity of living, breathing human beings. This can’t be forgotten or overlooked.
