# No-Code Method of Summarizing Anything
The sheer abundance of ChatGPT and generative AI tools can be overwhelming. 

To help you navigate this landscape, I thought I would begin sharing user-friendly, code-free methods for leveraging these emerging technologies. In this post, I'm going to show you how you can use Whisper AI, a speech-to-text tool from OpenAI, in tandem with ChatGPT.  
  
1\. Download Aiko for Mac. It's a free app that utilizes WhisperAI's API (an API is a tool that lets different software programs talk to each other).

[Aiko Download Link (Available on iOS and for Mac)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aiko/id1672085276)  
  
2\. Aiko has a simple interface. All you have to do is drop the audio file (let's say from your meeting) where the app says "drop audio or video file".  
  
3\. Aiko will transcribe the audio.  
  
4\. Copy the text from Aiko.

5\. Input your text into one of the following websites. Website (b) is more conservative and usually makes more chunks. I usually use website (a) with the default setting. Both let you customize the character count.  
  
a. [chatgptsplitter.com/](http://chatgptsplitter.com/)  
b. <https://lnkd.in/ga4M-vrG>  
  
6\. Copy "chunk 1" and send it as a prompt to ChatGPT. These sites add headers and footers that will tell ChatGPT to wait until you've sent all of the snippets.  
  
7\. Once you've shared the final "chunk" of text, ChatGPT will be waiting for your instructions.  
  
8\. At this point, you can tell ChatGPT whatever you want.  
  
\- Summarize the text shared with you in bullet form  
\- Summarize the text shared with you in table format. Column A should be major themes and Column be should be the points related to that theme  
\- Create a list of tasks  
\- Based on the transcript, what do you recommend [whatever]?  
\- Can you summarize the transcript in the voice of Jerry Seinfeld  
\- Based on the transcript, develop a script for a telenovela  
\- Write a rap in the style of Eminem about the transcript  
\- Summarize the transcript in Haiku form  
\- etc.
