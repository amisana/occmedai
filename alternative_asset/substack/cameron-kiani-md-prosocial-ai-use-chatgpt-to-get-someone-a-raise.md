# Prosocial AI: Use ChatGPT to Get Someone a Raise
There is no reason to expect or feel entitled to a positive experience in a transactional economy… 

However, against all odds, sometimes people are nice. 

That rarely translates to a pay raise, promotion, or even praise. 

Here is a prompt to help change that.

I’ve used this prompt three or four times to write “Recognition of Excellence” letters. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Here are two real e-mails I’ve received in response from supervisors.

 _Pharmacy_

> Thank you so much for your kind words! We are very proud to have [Pharmacist] and [Pharmacist] on our staff. They truly exemplify the high standards of care that our pharmacy aims to achieve.
> 
> I will share your praise with [Pharmacist], [Pharmacist] and the rest of the [the pharmacy] staff. I have cc’d our Senior Director and our Vice President to share your experience.

 _Doorman_

> Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your positive experience with [Doorman]. I truly appreciate your kind words and the feedback you provided.
> 
> I want to assure you that your feedback will not go unnoticed. I will make sure to share your comments with my senior leadership and management. It's important for them to know how our employees are making a positive impact. Receiving positive feedback like yours is always uplifting and serves as a great reminder that our team is doing a fantastic job. It motivates us to continue providing excellent service to everyone that enters our buildings.

> Once again, thank you for your kind words.

#### User Input

> 
>     I was recently at the Best Buy, your Best Buy, yesterday, December 5th. Jennifer helped me as I was looking for a new monitor. I didn't know what I needed or what I wanted, and I'm usually very picky and annoying. She was very patient, but also very efficient in providing me with assistance. There were a few moments where other customers needed help, and I felt like she handled that very well as well, given that that can be sometimes a difficult or awkward situation. I felt like she was able to respond to both me and the other customers appropriately. Professionally, she didn't feel like she was pushing me towards anything, more so that she was educating me, which made me so I could actually figure out what I wanted. Then, by the end of it, based on her expertise and her guidance, I found the monitor I liked. I'm using it right now. She was very efficient with checkout as well, having related to her that I was in a bit of a rush. That was also very much appreciated. I'm certainly going to return to the store

#### Chat GPT

> 
> During my visit, I was in need of a new monitor and had specific, albeit somewhat unclear, requirements. Jennifer's patient and informative approach helped me understand my options without feeling pressured to make a hasty decision.

> 
> Moreover, Jennifer's efficiency during the checkout process, particularly given my time constraints, was highly appreciated. Her dedication to ensuring a smooth and pleasant customer experience was evident throughout my interaction with her.
> 
> I would like to take this opportunity to underscore that Jennifer's remarkable service not only reflects well on her but also on you and your leadership. It is clear that the culture of excellence and care is nurtured from the top-down at Best Buy. While words of praise are important, I also hope that this recognition will be considered when matters of promotions, work balance, and pay arise, as tangible rewards are the ultimate acknowledgment of consistent high performance.

There have been numerous occasions where his proactive approach and innovative ideas have significantly enriched the gym experience.
